# Data Science and Large Language Models (LLMs) for Healthcare Improvement Analytics

This repository contains the work and methods developed during research projects aimed at leveraging data science techniques and large language models (LLMs) to explore healthcare incident reports and patient feedback. The projects focus on uncovering actionable insights to improve patient safety, operational efficiency, and service quality in healthcare institutions.

## Project 1: Large Language Models for Scaling up Proactive Learning in Healthcare

This project integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and LLMs to retrieve and analyze data from 500 narratives and 70 million healthcare incident reports. The primary goal is to enhance decision-making support for hospital managers by optimizing large language models for patient safety and operational management.

### Key Contributions:
1) Data Collection: Conducted extensive interviews with 100 hospital staff from various departments (e.g., Prisma Health and Childrenâ€™s Hospital) to gather insights into daily healthcare practices and challenges.
2) RAG Framework: Developed and deployed a RAG framework using GitHub for effective data retrieval and optimization of LLMs.
3) Model Optimization: Optimized Llama-3-70B and GPT-4o models using PyTorch and Hugging Face, incorporating prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques to adapt models for specific hospital needs.
4) Impact: Achieved an 82% reduction in patient wait times through the implementation of data-driven AI response strategies, delivering actionable insights for hospital administrators.

## Project 2: Patient Feedback Analysis Using Large Language Models

This project utilized LLMs such as Llama and Chat-GPT4-O to analyze 70,000 patient comments, extracting qualitative and quantitative insights to understand patient expectations and improve satisfaction in healthcare services.

### Key Contributions:
1) Sentiment Analysis: Implemented sentiment analysis to derive insights on patient attitudes and expectations.
2) SQL Integration: Used SQL to extract demographic and feedback data, building visualizations with Google Analytics for insights into patient behavior and healthcare outcomes.
3) Regression Analysis: Applied R to perform regression analysis on patient feedback data, uncovering key factors driving patient satisfaction and service quality.
4) Impact: Insights from this analysis led to a 52% improvement in patient satisfaction, influencing targeted interventions to enhance hospital service.

## Repository Contents
1) Data Analytics and Exploration: Contains all the core scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and feedback analysis.
2) Healthcare RAG: RAG Framework development leverages large language models (LLMs) and integrates them with an optimized data retrieval mechanism to aid decision-making in patient safety and operational management.
3) LLM Research: Contains the code and configuration files necessary for setting up and running LLM models inside a containerized environment using Apptainer
4) PPLOP: Using perplexity to guide discrete optimization of prompts for LLM-driven open-ended categorization.
